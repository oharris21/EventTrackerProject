## Event Tracker Project

### Overview
Nutrition Tracker takes a users information and simply keeps track of their daily macronutrient needs to reach their fitness goals. This app is much more about me learning how to incorporate Angular into the front end of a project than it is about functionality and styling. 

This is the first full stack application I've built that uses Angular. It performs basic CRUD operations, all without refreshing the browser! 

### Technologies Used
* Java
* SQL
* Javascript 
* Angular
* Spring REST
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA

### Lessons Learned 
My biggest takeway was learning how to traverse through Angular classes in a development environment. This project was done at the end of my first week learning Angular so some of it was still pretty new to me! 

On the Java side, utilizing Spring Data JPA and it's Query DSL made my backend logic more efficient since I didn't have to write bunch of custom queries and methods.
