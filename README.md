## Event Tracker Project

### Overview
Nutrition Tracker takes a users information and simply keeps track of their daily macronutrient needs to reach their fitness goals. This app is much more about me learning how to incorporate Angular into the front end of a project than it is about functionality and styling. 

This is the first full stack application I've built that uses Angular. It performs basic CRUD operations, all without refreshing the browser. 

### Technologies Used
* Java
* SQL
* Javascript 
* Angular
* Spring REST
* Spring Boot

### Lessons Learned 
My biggest takeway was learning how to traverse through Angular classes in a development environment. It is actually very similar to building a Java application in Spring as I am used to doing. My biggest challenge was remembering what all of the different classes are used for and which code needs to go in each one. This project was done at the end of my first week learning Angular.
